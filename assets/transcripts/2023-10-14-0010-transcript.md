*AH:* 

My name is Alexia, and I'm interviewing the community member Prisma who contributed object ID 2023-10-14-0010 as part of La Casa's 50th anniversary Community archive. For my first question, which memory would you like to share with us today? 

 

***PM:*** 

Um, so, the memory of actually being part of La Casa since I was in middle school actually. So, I went through a mentoring program here uh, it was called, it was uh, Latinas en Acción. It was back in the day, and the only reason I was part of the mentoring program was because my sister was part of it so, I was kind of tagging along. Um, but then uh, later on, I participated in high school as well um, and because of them and just like the nourishing and the just like the welcoming aspect of like all of these women who didn't know me, um, the director who kind of took me under the wing um, is the reason why I came to IU, was the reason why um, I've gotten to where I've been as far as my career. 

 

***S1:*** 

Wow. I mean, that’s like, I don't want to say beautiful, but like, beautiful. That you’ve just like, been a part of it for so long.  

 

***IR:***

Yeah.  

 

*AH:* 

And so, you know, why is this memory significant to you? Like, is there any more you'd like to add? You kind of talked about it, but.  

 

***IR:***

Yeah! So, um, at first, so growing up in Bloomington so, I'm actually from the area. So, I was born in Toluca, Mexico, but I actually grew up in Bloomington since I was 5. So, being part of a predominantly  caucasian community um, does have an effect on your identity and trying to see like, where you fall in. And so, learning that there was Latinos in college. First of all, learning what college was and how important that is to that can be to your future if you choose it to be. Um, I just thought that it was just um, so such an encouragement um, that our faces are able to be successful in college. You know, someone like me can do it, um, and that we have support not just alone. So, that's why. That's another significance. 

 

*AH:* 

Okay. And kind of answered some of my other questions --(laughter)--and that's fine. Um, so is there anything else you'd like to talk about, like concerning, you know, your memory about La Casa and just, you know, anything in particular? 

 

***IR:***

Yeah. So, like, like I said, I could, I could sit here and talk about, La Casa forever because I have been here since I was, um, you know, since I was in middle school. But um, just growing up here, it's um, growing up in Bloomington IU is in your backyard, but you don't necessarily know if you're going to be part of it. And I knew early on in high school that I was not going to be part of it because I'm undocumented at the time. I have DACA now, but at the time it was, it didn't exist. So, it's one of those things that your counselor already had predestined you that you could not go to college.  

 

*AH:* 

Wow. 

 

***IR:***

And so, yeah, so it was very impactful. But then I was so determined um, and I uh, sought out, you know, questions, and I sought out the director, and I sought out a lot of people um, who were undergrad and grad here, just asking all the questions. And then also um, there was another program that I was part of that Lillian um, introduced me to um, in um,Indianapolis. It was a, a week, kind of like a week event of a series of events, and that was the reason why I was like, no, I have to go to college. Even if I put myself through Ivy Tech, even if I like, um, have to pay myself, I'll do it. Um, and then I, I made it happen, and then it was um, really hard for, for somebody who was undocumented to apply for IU. And then finally I got accepted. And and just like getting accepted was a whole other level my, my, it was like when I got the letter um, still being undocumented, I mean still being under scrupulous of, like, not knowing what's going to happen, but just getting the letter and just seeing my parents face it was like we all got accepted. So, it was like very emotional for me. But I feel like once I was actually in college, like, it just became so surreal. Um, and it just, I was like, it didn't, I didn't feel like I could believe that I was here. But at the same time, like I had made it. And then I went through the whole thing and did-- got my degree in telecommunication and still it just felt like you get your imposter syndrome all of a sudden that you're going to graduate and then um, when people ask me like, oh, like you went to IU, that's so great. I'm like, yeah, I did-- from the community, people in the community that know my situation that-- they get so excited. And I'm like, yeah, I did graduated. I may have walked, but um, sorry.  

*AH:* 

You’re good. 

 

***IR:***

It’s, I get so emotional when I talk about my parents. But I, I tell them like I may have walked myself, but like my parents graduated with me that day. And so um, it's IU and like, La Casa I fell like, are a huge impact, and not just like my existence, and then my success as a person who has a career now, thanks to La Casa and to IU. 

 

*AH:* 

Wow, I mean, that’s amazing. So, I mean, just like I can see like your passion and just like how much it all makes you. So thank you for sharing your story, is there anything else you'd like to? No? 

 

***IR:***

No, sorry I’m like, emotional. 

 

*AH:* 

Thank you, No, thank you

Alright, so now we're recrording and have to start this preliminary step. All right? My name is Dhakir Abdullah and I'm interviewing the community member who contributed object ID 202310140016 as part of La Casa's 50th anniversary community archives. Now this is a interview about two objects, so I'll say with the first question so you know each question I asked you, you would just be kind of answering about both, but what is the name, what are the names of your objects? And you can speak about them and either or either or order in which you want to speak with. Speak about them in. 

***AF:***

OK. Well, the first picture that I provided is a picture of  little 50 Mezcla team, it is the women's team and the men's team a photo of of all of us together during qualifications and I believe this photo is the qualifications for little 50 Mezcla women's team to run for little 50 and that's the first photo. You want me to speak on the second one or is this just the first? 

*DA:*

OK. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So for each question, just OK, this one and then that one. So, OK, what's the name of the object? The same question. 

***AF:***

Yep. And so the second object it is women's little 50 women's Mezcla team and this is the day of the race this picture and also the previous one were from 2006 and the the the significance of this picture is this is the first little 50 Mezcla women's team to run and it started in 2006. 

*DA:*

OK, OK. Some of these questions might overlap where you might have to. Repeat some of that information, given that you kind of touched on a few different things. When and where did you acquire these items, what year, city, et cetera? And of course, we know it's the pictures. 

***AF:***

Absolutely. So both these pictures are from 2006 and a little bit of history behind the pictures. 

*DA:*

OK. 

***AF:***

Little 50. There was already a little 50 Mezcla men's team, and so one of the goals for in 2006 was to establish a women's little 50 Mezcla team. And so I was part of that endeavor and I worked in recruiting other people to be part of it and we garnered interest and then we started training for it and and the first picture is is that shows the qualifications. That is when we ran and and qualified to run for the race amongst the other, I think it was, maybe over 20 teams that ran and I don't remember how many were selected, but we were able to qualify for the for the race. 

*DA:*

Now you already covered like the third question, so I won't ask it. Because when we're talking about the date specifically, you have like a broad date of 2006, right? 

***AF:***

Yeah. So the pictures of themselves were probably sometime, I don’t know. I'm trying to remember the time frame of 1 little 50 and when little 5 take place takes place. Believe it's like towards the end of April 2006 so. That's when the pictures would. Have been would have. That's when. Pictures took place, but then? The recruiting efforts, the training, all that was done prior that led up to those all in 2006. That led up to the pictures. 

*DA:*

OK. How would you now we know that these are digital objects, but how would you physically describe your objects? So what I'm asking in this way is like, you can describe it however you want, but looking at it, at the photo, like what is being captured there, so on and so forth, you feel me? 

***AF:***

Yes. So the first photo is the group of both the men's Mezcla team and the women's Mezcla team, and I don't remember if it was all of all of us. Because we also, I mean there's a lot of, there's a lot of women in this picture and there's three men and typically you would have 4 individuals run in each team, like the four Mezcla men's team and four women Mezcla team members. In any event, the significance of this picture is that this was right after. So we all trained together, we all rooted, we all like pushed each other. The men would train on their own, but sometimes their their training would overlap with ours and I feel like this picture, this this was right after we ran for qualifications and we were all really excited. We were pumped. And this is kind of a picture of unity, of just like this sort of, and again, this qualifications. But it was like, oh, we we're doing this where this is, this is like a team, like a family and and that the excitement of that. And then the second picture is I I describe it as as as a victory for us, right where we actually participated in the race and we were able to and I don't remember if it was taken before we ran or after we we ran the race, but it just to me the picture of our pride and and excitement for for starting this this race or starting this this team to participate in in little 50. 

*DA:*

OK, OK, cool, cool. Now you might have covered this in the question I just asked you, but if you have any more to say, I'll ask this question is what is the object significance? The objects’. Do you feel like you covered that enough? 

***AF:***

Well, I'll just add this too, because you know a lot of it is, is, is the pride and the excitement of having a women's Mezcla team participate in little 50, but part of for, for for the significance for me is bringing the community together to rally around this being being able to participate. Bringing women's Mezcla team to the to this event leading up to it, we I remember we we met at La Casa where we created posters. We brought people out to participate in and watched the races and it really it's it. It brought it to see it as a bringing together a community and and too, I don't know if we they, if there is still a women at little 50 women's Mezcla team, but I do know that after that year the Mezcla had a women's team running little 54 the for the next 10 years because I came. Back for the 10 10 year reunion of the of of of Mezcla's existence, at least in the running, the running team, and it was just really exciting to see that that is still, that was still continued over the years. So we were able to keep up with it and and you know another way to establish our pride and and our and our identity on this campus. 

*DA:*

I feel that. All right, so when you see these objects, what kinds of memories do they bring up? 

***AF:***

Oh, the memory. So the memories is the memories that that, that these pictures bring up is of friendship, of meeting new people. Of bringing each other to our respective communities and friendships. So kind of expanding on on our on our friendships, new connections, empowering each other. I mean, I remember even when we were training, we would we would push each other, but we would encourage each other. We would keep track of each other. Like when we were training or we if we were keeping up with our regimen, you know, even courses, I mean, if we were struggling with class, I think we we checked up on each other and then just the the memories of just like being able to go out and do just of. Of unity and community. 

*DA:*

OK, OK, very good, very good. Thanks for sharing that. If you're an IU Alum, how does this object relate to your experience at IU? 

***AF:***

Man, I am an IU Alum. And it it is part of my. It is I I feel a lot of pride for being able to help establish this team again, and I I don't know if they still they're they're still a women's Mezcla team, but for a long time, a lot like the women kept it. It was still a there was still a team every year of women participating in it. And so there's just. A lot of, a lot of. I keep saying pride, but also I'm, I'm very proud, very, very proud to have been part of that part, part of helping create it. 

*DA:*

OK, OK. How does this object relate to your, these objects relate to your identity. 

***AF:***

So, Mezcla means a mixture and a mixture of to me it's it's it's, it's means like diversity, diverse ideas, diverse community. So the Latino community is a diverse community of different ethnicities, of different races, of different. You know of different languages and so it relates to my background of being Mexican, of growing up in a community where with other Latinos and just other a variety of different cultures. And so the pictures, to me being part of what Mezcla meant and even in the team we had a wide variety of individuals from different backgrounds it meant. The inclusivity, diversity and and that’s all. 

*DA:*

Very good, very good. Oh, I'm sorry. Did I cut you off? 

***AF:***

Nope, that was I was trying to think of what else to say, but I think that's, that was all. 

*DA:*

OK, now is there. Is there anything I didn't ask about these objects that you would ike to talk about? 

***AF:***

I don't think so. I think you've captured, I think you've captured it all. Yeah, yeah. 

*DA:*

Alrighty, y'all set. I'm gonna go ahead and turn the recorder off.

So my name is Alexia. I am interviewing the Community Member, Maria, who contributed object ID 2023-10-14-0006 as part of La Casa's 50th Anniversary Community Archive. So Maria, which memory would you like to share with us today? 

***ML:***

One of the my favorite memories is the support in the community that, La Casa gave to me when I had no one. Being a single parent was so hard and then trying to get an education was even harder. But La Casa you always, I mean I I could always bank on coming here with my son, and people not being angry about Felipe being around, playing around and then us being able to take time for not only myself, but to study, to get myself grounded. And I just told someone today that IU means a lot to me. But La Casa means even more because I am not who I am, I am who I am because of La Casa. It really it. You felt accepted here as a Hispanic in a world that's so different, because that's all I ever lived with it was within the Hispanic community. So you come to IU and you become very alone. I mean, you're on your own, your parents really have no clue. So having a lot, lot of people, you know, Latinos that you're around, you're speaking, you're eating. And so we spent a lot of time here. So it's my home away from home. And then Georgia was here and she was like our mom, so that was even better. But little Phil even remembers a lot of his life here, and I so contribute my success to, to everything that was given to me here, I'm, you know unconditionally, so. 

*AH:*

No, I mean that's beautiful though. Like I can see you're getting so emotional about it too. So I know it's like, really there, it hits you. 

***ML:***

It is so when I got to see the e-mail about coming to the 50th anniversary. Like there's no. I don't even hesitate immediately started signing, I signed up to come. So I. 

*AH:*

I feel like you kind of answered the second question, so I'm going to move on to the third question. So you said you're an IU Alum? So how does this memory, you know, relate to your experience at IU and you know? And you even mentioned your son. 

***ML:***

Success. That education is so important. You know, that's I'm a first generation and because of me, I've had my sister, Alicia, who also graduated from IU and then Macrina, of all people who. You know, so it's like, oh, my gosh. And being empowered that's that's that's what I do. I want to encourage Latinos to go to school as a nurse. I see aids that are out there. And you can see they have so much potential. It's like, my God, don't stop here. You know, I'll even help you get get into school. So that's that's been my goal. All my life is to. You know, to encourage and empower Latinas and Latinos, there's there's so much out there that you can do and you know and go to school. Yeah. There's so much help. So, yes. 

*AH:*

You know, I I feel that first-gen, like college students, I I feel that. So how would you say that this memory relates to your identity? I'd like. You touched a. Little bit I'd like. To hear more about it. 

***ML:***

Well, you come. And I say it's a a white man's world. I I remember the day. I've never seen anybody with different color eyes. Obviously that's to me, I've I'll never forget that coming in into the cafeteria and a friend came right up to me, and she was like, Estella, Estella! There's someone here with blue eyes. There's like, no way! So it's all about it's learning the culture. I mean, I was never introduced to anything but Puerto Ricans, Hispanics, Cubans. You know, anybody. Everybody that spoke Spanish. So coming out of that, would I say, a bubble and coming here was a shock to me. And so my life, I I've traveled, I love life and that's all I want to do is just learning. I feel I'm a sponge because of what happened to me here. It's like, wow, there's a world out there that I don't know. So that's. 

*AH:*

Is that you keep mentioning. That you like came here to like Bloomington and like and IU so. Where did you come and like when did you come from? 

***ML:***

It was race, and being told that I was retarded. Being abused at school, had no clue about English until I was went to 4th grade, so education was not even I knew nothing. I just knew that I needed to go to school, that's all, and it took it was I was in 8th grade when an English teacher came up to me and said, Oh my God, you're not retarded. The issue is that you don't know English and she asked me if I wanted to learn. I ended up finishing school. 1/2 a semester. Early and then that's what I was introduced to the group's program and that's how I got the full scholarship to come here to IU. 

*AH:*

So just one final thing, is there anything else you would like to share that I haven't asked you about? 

***ML:***

Yes, I one of the things that I talked to someone about today is I get all information in the mail with IU, but I don't hear anything about La Casa. And the need for financial help. La Casa is so important. To let it go would be devastating. So I would like to hear information about how people can contribute to the need here and make sure that it comes here. The money comes here versus the administration because that. La Casa meant a lot to me, and I'm sure it is helping a lot of other people than myself. Yes. So I would like to help in that way. 

*AH:*

I'm sure that when you're checking out, I'm sure you can ask and hopefully someone can help you out with that then and we can find out more information about that then. So thank you, Maria, for your participation.

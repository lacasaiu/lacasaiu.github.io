The memories of us kind of bringing and establishing Omega Phi Beta sorority incorporated. Here, you'll see pictures of us you know, in our professional attire and also like when we first crossed and and entered into, you know, the Greek life. We brought an organization that was envisioned to empower women, as well as bringing community to the IU campus, so you'll see the so much support that we, unconditional support that we received from the community as we brought through this sorority. And I'll have my line sisters here that I can't imagine my life without them. It was a pivotal time like coming to La Casa thinking, "OK, one day I like I think I want to do Great Life" and meeting five other just phenomenal women that have, you know, been so supportive and, you know, change the trajectory of how I felt like I didn't really fit into the the IU campus being so huge and finally finding kind of your home away from home, that story, but also giving back to the community and supporting other women in the campus so they felt there was a safe place, safe place for them to come together and and empower one another.

When looking back on those photos and the time and just the support that we received from La Casa and other groups on campus and the moral support and how much they were wanting us and wanting to connect and do programming and just the love we received coming onto campus, it's just heartwarming to see that and having that group connection and

also, is knowing that being able to come and connect with others and have that joined feeling and having a warehouse just definitely made me feel safer on campus and more connected in a way and have the platform to be able to speak out and help others and make other people feel safer as well. 

 

*AH:* 

You like to comment on the first one, OK? Would you guys like to say anything else about like why this memory significant to you or anything about how it relates to your experience at IU anymore? Would you like to comment anything else?

For for me, I guess we brought an organization that was very strategic and in the sense of like the philanthropy, right, we had seen during the time that I mean we when we were freshmen sophomores, it was the time where we were interested women. We didn't bring the organization until some of those were juniors or seniors. So, there was a lot of conversations about women who didn't have a safe space to talk about either domestic or sexual abuse, and we really brought an organization that made it safe for them, made it. We made sure that we were the women that people could go to if they didn't know anywhere else to go and during the time and I I know there's still times where those conversations are difficult. That's what that's the the beauty of our organization. That will always stand for that and that's something that I'm so, so grateful for it, but also very proud of and something that we're always going to treasure and that's why we're still allowed to get them all right. 

 

*AH:* 

Would you guys like to share more about how this memory memory relates to your identity? Because it kind of touched on, but I don't know if you have any more to say. 

 

***MC:***

It is so much part of as an alum, one, so being able to be connected to our experience that was so shaping for me, but also having that continued community that looking back on and the events that happened, but being able to come back to 50th anniversary and spend that time with people I care about and feel safe with and see those friendly faces, and being on a campus that didn't mean so much and just remembering why we made the choices that we did and the pride and seeing how that legacy has continued on and continued to grow has been really fulfilling and just amazing 

 

***CY:*** 

It's my excuse to come back here, you know, and just see how something so small of six, you know, you know, diverse women coming together to create the, you know, to establish the organization onto the campus or wasn't previously. And just seeing how much it's grown like it still continues to attract like-minded women and still continue to support and whether or not you join the organization, we're here for women and it's it's just the beauty of it. And just that sisterhood, you know, sisterhood is, is you know it's a verb it's it's making those actions and taking those those safe steps to to be there and show up and and we continue to do and as you see us alumni coming back here just brings goosebumps and and just just so much joy just to be here and this radiant campus. 

 

*AH:* 

I mean, it's amazing to see your guy's connections and your friendship still like, you know, lasting even after graduation. So, one final question though, is there anything I didn't ask that you guys would like to talk about? Any final words? 

 

***DL:*** 

I I guess I would just like to touch on the fact that when we established the organization, we truly felt a sense of unity within the the Greek Community and something that when I looked back, I I treasure right? I think that throughout the years is that's something that we have to continue to keep and I think La Casa forms a huge part of that, right, because it's the one place that we all come together so I just hope to see that that continues and that it continues to grow within the great community, especially the multicultural Greeks. 

 

***MC:***

I would agree with that. I mean, looking at the wall right in front of us and seeing the representation for most groups that don't get much representation on campus being how small and with the multicultural aspects of it, but just having it be a place where they all do feel welcome and have a voice and have continue to have a voice is amazing. Just a lot has the support La Casa has provided not only to our organization, but to so many other and just wonderful and happy to celebrate that. 

 

*AH:* 

That's it. Thank you, Deisy. Carlie. Mariana. I'm going to go ahead and end it.

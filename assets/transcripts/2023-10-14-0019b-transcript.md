My name is Vanessa, and interviewing community member, contributing object ID 2023-10-14-0019, Part 2. So I will talk about the second photo here. So can you tell me the name of this of this photo where also physically describe what it what are what we are seeing? 

 

***CS:*** 

Oh, yes. So this is when this is of Cesar Chavez, when it came to La Casa. And I'm not quite sure of the date, but I know that you have the date. It was a packed house when you came. I'm in the photo. It must have been late 80s when he when he came to the to the. So he came to La Casa first and I believe that evening he spoke at Union board, but we also had an evening event with him at dinner. It was very hospitable. He was signing autographs, open to taking pictures. He, I think later in the evening we even had we were dancing, people were dancing with him, you know, it was just just having a good time with Cesar Chavez. You know what I mean? Who can say that and and of course the message he gave during the Union board, the presentation that he gave was was wonderful, but very down to Earth. It just just you could tell kind of that the feeling he gave it was just a beautiful experience to be able to meet him. 

 

*VE:* 

Do you know if there's a particular reason why we had invited him? 

 

***CS:*** 

Oh well, who was one of the Union Board lectures? It must have been. I wish I remembered the flyer that the date from yesterday and the flyer. It may have been during Hispanic Heritage Month or one of the special presenters through Union Board because we would advocate for them to get more Latino speakers as opposed to, you know, the same wonderful speakers so that they bring in but having representation. Yeah. At one point too, Martin Sheen was supposed to come, one of my favorite actors, and we were just so excited too for Martin going to come, we were cooking, and then the weather. Couldn't come because of the weather. He was coming was coming from California, so just the opportunities we had through La Casa were great. Tito Puente coming, I'm sure the folks have talked about that was wonderful. Paul Rodriguez, who's a comedian. So if they had a Union Board present presentation, they're Latino, they would come here. To come to La Casa and present. And so that's Mr. Chavez. 

 

*VE:* 

You kind of talked a little bit about it do is there anything else in terms of the significance of this photo that you would want to talk about? 

 

***CS:*** 

No, I just, I just again it's just another experience and kind of the opportunities you get through La Casa. You know one of the things too, it's just you know, I was part of the IUI Latinos Unidos at IU being being on the board, being involved in there too. Gets you also involvement in helping to plan these types of events, which are wonderful too. I worked at La Casa as a counselor for three years right after I finished my undergraduate degree. That was a great opportunity to work with the students here and that was back in 87 to 90, more or less. So is a, is a quite quite a different world back then so you can see all the people, it was, it was just the energy was Just beautiful at La Casa. I remember that evening. Yeah. And I was very nervous to, 

 

*VE:* 

you could see there's a little bit 

 

***CS:*** 

of distance between me and him because I didn't want to like hover him. But it was like he was signing something for me. So I have something at home that I could not find. And it was just neat, yeah. 

 

*VE:* 

Wonderful. What kinds of memories does it, Sir talked about it already. What kind of memories does this photo bring up for you? 

 

***CS:*** 

Well, one, I'm very young there, but, you know, when we'd come to La Casa as students, you'd come and you would come during breaks. Or maybe you had lunch, or you're just waiting for a class and you see people you knew. You come down here and you'd watch TV. There used to be a TV in this room or play ping pong, or you just sit around. You just talk or meet new people. It was just a neat, you know, I think for you, too. 

 

***GH:***

Yeah, it was. Yeah, come out here and just hang out watch the the Cubs play or something. Whatever was on TV. And then you go back to class. So it's it was a break from their daily routine of the classes and going back and forth. 

 

*VE:* 

OK, how does it relate to your experience here at IU? You talked a little bit about it but if there's anything else. 

 

***CS:*** 

Oh, just in general. I mean, yeah, just the opportunities through IU through I think one of the biggest pieces being involved in different organizations. Whatever you can get involved in, whatever your interest is, is important because that's really going to make the connections for other things through your, you know, through IUI I did a lot of planning with our sports fest that we held and just other events when I worked at La Casa planning. And right now I work in learning development. I lead our delivery of learning for the United States and Canada and Latin America for for the company I work for. That experience even back then has helped because it's the planning, the thinking and thinking through how to do things. I mean, that's kind of I built those skills through the years, but it started here. 

 

*VE:* 

Oh, that's wonderful. We'll have to share that with Lillian too. Have to think. Yeah. Think through how those experiences back then are helping you many years later. Is there anything that you would like to share about this object that we haven't talked about? 

 

***CS:*** 

Exactly. Oh, I'm just wondering if that gold plaque in the back is still on the wall because it's been back there, I'm not even quite sure what it is. If it's on the wall upstairs at all. 

 

*VE:* 

You know, I'm not sure we could check. 

 

***CS:*** 

Yeah, yeah there is a day I just realized I must have written the date on the back. 

 

*VE:* 

Oh, do you want to read what's on there? 

 

***CS:*** 

Sure, it says Cesar 1990. So I've already I was working at La Casa then I was the counselor here apparently. Cesar Chavez and Cynthia Salinas. La Casa, 715 E 7th St. Bloomington. 1990 wonderful. I'm glad I wrote the date. 

 

*VE:* 

I'm going to double check that we also captured the back of that. OK. Well, thank you so much for sharing.

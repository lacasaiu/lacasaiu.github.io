So, my name is Alexia, and I'm interviewing the community member, Deisy, who contributed object ID Number 2023-10-14-0018. So my first question, Deisy is which memory would you like to share with us today? 

 

***DL:*** 

Yeah. So, the memories I shared are from a few pictures. They were from the first retreat that I organized as the grad assistant when I was here back in 2015 and 2016, and and in the picture, it's really memorable for me because not only was it my first retreat organized and as grad assistant, but it was also the first year that my brother was here as a freshman. So, it brought kind of my two worlds together for the first time and as the oldest daughter of immigrants, it was just that the first true representation that I was like, "Oh wow, I'm really paving the way for for the family." So that's why I chose it. 

 

*AH:*

Is there anything any other reason you'd like to mention about why it's significant to you or? 

 

***DL:*** 

It also shows a lot of the other students that went to the retreat, younger, like undergrads. And I just remember how the bonds that I formed as a grad assistant with undergrads and how they would come and look for further, older, older sister Deisy to ask for advice or when they were stressed. So it just brought back a lot of good memories. 

 

*AH:*

And as an IU Alum, are there any other memories you'd like to share relating to this experience. 

 

***DL:*** 

So, at the retreat, or more in in general for La Casa, I think La Casa for me was the home away from home for ever since I joined IU, but more importantly if it wasn't for Lillian, I wouldn't even have graduated. So, when she met me, as I saw as a freshman in college, I was so ready to actually transfer out because I was so, I was missing my home. I was stressed because I wasn't a direct admit to Kelly, so I was trying to get in. And she sat me in her office. One day I was in tears, and she was like literally, I had the form open ready to do the transfer and she was like, "Hold off one, hold off your whole year of freshman. If you want to leave after you're done with your freshman year, then I'll help you make sure that all your credits transfer and everything is works out." So after that I listened to her reluctantly. And then I got admitted into Kelly sophomore year, and the rest is history. And honestly, my career, my everything would have changed so drastically if that moment wouldn't have happened. So that's why I'm here today to honor her, to honor La Casa. But but really for the respect that she earned. So yeah. 

 

*AH:*

How does this memory relate to your identity? 

 

***DL:*** 

Well, yeah, exactly that I mean now I mean everything I am is my career, right? So, like it's such a big part of who I am now. So, I work in finance and then think back about those days where I'm like I there was times where I didn't think I was even going to get admitted into Kelly School and and then fast forward a few years, I graduated with an MBA, right? So, like, it really defined who I am but also made me grateful of how hard it was because now I understand the struggles that the students go through. My sister's now a freshman, so I now she has someone in the family that she can go to and say, "Hey, I'm stressed." I can and I can relate to her where when I was in her shoes, even when I was stressed, I wouldn't go to the family because no one understood. Right? So. So, yeah. So now I'm like, well, now I get to give her, like, what are those, like, the boxes where like the the like other people that have parents that would give them like in college during finals? Care packages, right? And so, I was like, I would all be so jealous. And I'm like, oh, my white friends would get care packages. But my parents didn't know what that was. So now I get to do that to my sister which I think is, it's amazing. 

 

*AH:*

Have one final question. So, is there anything else that I haven't asked that you would like to talk about? 

 

***DL:*** 

Well, the, the bonds that I formed like as a were to this day some of my closest people that I have, so they not only did I meet the woman who then started mega Phi Beta sort incorporated at camp on campus until in 2015. But also, they are the people that I love, and hold hold dearly till this day. How many years later struck? 

 

*AH:*

Well, thank you, Deisy. I'm going to go ahead and stop it.

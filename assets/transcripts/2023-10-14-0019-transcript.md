***CS:***

Oh, it's a photo of five people who are dressed in folklore dance and it was a session that was held an event for the International Day. I think it was in spring of 1985. 

 

*VE:* 

OK. Who? You said five people are in the in the?  

 

***CS:***

In photo, let's see 1, 2, is it 5 people? Six people. Sorry, yeah. 

 

*VE:* 

Six people. 

 

***GH:*** 

4 girls. 

 

*VE:* 

OK. 

 

***GH:*** 

2 guys. 

 

*VE:* 

And where was the photo taken? 

 

***CS:***

It was at the Fine Arts Center. 

 

*VE:* 

OK, yeah. And you said it was in 19. 

 

 

***CS:***

It was in April of 1984. Sorry, 

 

Speaker 

84. 

 

*VE:* 

Four, so were you all part of the the? 

 

***CS:***

This was actually. Yeah, it was a one-time thing. It was international, fair and through the person that's up right here. She knew how to dance these two women, these two students. And so, they basically said, "OK, can you guys perform? Can does somebody know how to do it?" She looked for volunteers. She taught us how to dance. I had never danced before. And this one right here. This person actually was able to. She danced before, was able to get her the costumes and dresses. She brought them for her from an existing dance troupe and. 

 

*VE:* 

Can you describe what we're seeing in the photo like the outfits that that folks are wearing? 

 

***CS:***

Yeah, well, they're traditional folkloric dresses. They're red with white, white lace on the upper bodice part and green. The women have long, flowy dresses, of course, I recall, and then green rebolosos is what some of us have. And we have red bows in our hair and it was just a wonderful experience for me. We're all for East Chicago, except Tito Parrillas who is from Union City. And I'm going to go ahead and say their names. That's Darcy Espinoza from East Chicago, Laura Volterra from East Chicago, Griselda Palma from Fort Wayne, that's me, Cindy Salinas Herrera, and then Gonzalo Herrera, who's my partner, who, 25 years later became a husband. 

 

*VE:* 

So what's the significance of like this event and also thinking about how it relates to your experience being here at IU? 

 

***CS:***

Yeah. I think for me it was I had always wanted to dance folkloric and I didn't growing up and this was a great opportunity to learn. I had two left feet, but I tried my best. We were on a big stage right after us was the salsa band, the XXX possible name of the band salsa band performed, so it was all different types of performances that day and it was great. It was a wonderful experience, I don't know about Gonzalo, who's sitting next to me if you have anything? 

 

***GH:*** 

It's it's something you know completely new and different for me and I said, "well, why not?" You know, I was proud of my heritage and I said, well, this, you know, contribute to that and be a a fun thing to do. And it was. It wasn't, it didn't take that long to from start to finish learning the steps. But once we did that, we were ready to go. And I think we did pretty good. 

 

*VE:* 

And looking at the photo and you know, being back here at IU, what kind of memories does this photo bring up for you all? 

 

***CS:***

Oh, well, I mean it's just a being student at Indiana University and then La Casa is just a beautiful, absolutely wonderful, beautiful experience that helped for me in all different ways, it just opened up my world coming away to school, but also just meeting all of my great friends in life I met here through La Casa and then having this opportunity. I've never danced this since, but it was just a cool experience to be able to do it. And I know that I had a few missteps, but it was like OK, but it was still fun it and it was a way for me to because I was shy, and it was ready for me to push myself. Right? You're you're performing in front of a bunch of people. And so, with the group though, we kind of held each other together to to kind of get through. And I think we had rehearsals here where we're sitting right now. Yeah. 

 

***GH:*** 

Yeah, we did. I know it's funny because you know she and her, she was my partner. And in this in this dance. And then like Cindy said, you know, later on she's a partner left. So you never know, you know when you meet somebody at at in advance or something, so go out and and and be open to new experiences because you never know what's going to happen in the future. 

 

*VE:* 

Is there anything that you could talk about in relation to this or your experience at IU in relation to your identity? 

 

***CS:***

Oh, again because I had never done it and I wanted to, we couldn't afford it. We're we're low, right? The costumes and all. So being able to go away to school and then boom, I get to do it. It was the, my the spring of the freshman year, so I was a freshman 83-84 and it was like, oh, and it just felt great to be able to express myself this way and learn it and just feel more connected, I think, and to share it with people that that attended that event because it was a packed house and it was performance is different things all day but It was. It was. a great. So, we always wondered if there's some footage because they were taping it. Yeah, there's some footage somewhere. 

 

***GH:*** 

Yeah, we that's we keep thinking about someone, someone must have that must be archived some of the video footage and 

 

***CS:***

It could be. 

 

***GH:*** 

And that would be great to see. 

 

*VE:* 

Yeah, it could be. Maybe the university archives or or something like that. I know Lillian has been giving them a lot of material, so. Is there anything that I didn't ask you about the photo that you would like to share with us? Or anything about sharing it with in terms of your relation as a student here at IU? 

 

***CS:***

Yeah, you know, we keep this on our mantal at home, not only because you know, we we're married, but it's just a nice reminder of some of the best times in our lives. We've had a great life. I mean, we're just wonderful experiences that IU and La Casa has given us through our education through meeting people. It's it's just a great reminder and everyone we know, and we talked to this day, there's no one that we're not in touch with. 

 

***GH:*** 

Yeah, yeah, I'm still friends with Tito, you know? We still get together Once in a while you build. 

 

***CS:***

You know, we just went to his daughters Quinceanera this summer. 

 

***GH:*** 

Yeah, it was really nice. And so good. Last long relationships by going into these events. 

 

***CS:***

That's wonderful.

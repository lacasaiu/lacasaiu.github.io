My name is Alexia, and I'm interviewing the community member Angel, who contributed object ID number 2023-10-14-0012 as part of La Casa's 50th anniversary Community Archive. So my first question is, which memory would you like to share with us today? 

 

***AH:*** 

So the memory or image I'm submitting is the new member presentation of my uh, or my new member presentation into the Latino-based fraternity that I joined here on campus um, is a memory that you get revealed to the rest of campus and the community that we have here, the small intimate community that I have that. Which is an important date for me, because when I got here on campus, I didn’t really know if there was a community for me. And then I think just looking around and I knew I had a, a, an IU alumni, which was my uncle that had it was in the same fraternity like over, I would say 15 years ago and he recommended like to look out for them and I did. And once I, I got to contact with them, they welcomed me with open arms. And they showed me like their and although it's hard to find the communities here. And after that I uh, I joined the organization and from that day that knew-- like when I was revealed, it's been nothing but good uh, good memories and experiences. I've got to uh, participate in gain professionalism and like business meetings and like interacting with a bunch of people. And then like it's also opened doors to other organizations like that I would never, never met if I didn't join this org. And I guess that's why this memory is important to me. It's a, it's a good stepping stone of what I didn't know what IU campus had to offer. 

 

*AH:* 

And then you said you’re a current IU student. So how has this memory like related to your experience so far? And then maybe like even how do you think it will affect you in the future? 

 

***AH:*** 

Yeah, I would say, um I’ve met a lot of people through the org and a lot of people in other organizations through the org. So like, it’s made the community feel more close knit than instead of being spread out. I know like my first couple weeks I was here on campus as transfer student. I struggled to find people that looked like me, but as soon as I, I looked for it, I found it. And then now that I know everyone is just a tight-knit community that I can just talk to anyone and it's it's nice. If I'm going to the IMU (Indiana Memorial Union) I recognize people there. I go to the library, I know people there just because they look like me. We can just talk about, talk--it makes talking easier and kind of just easier. And from there um, I know that I've gained a lot of, like I said, professionalism and meetings and stuff, but I know that when I'm actually going into my career, I have connections that will be able to help me find internships, find jobs, or just help me with fresh professional development through this work. 

 

*AH:* 

And how does this memory relate to your identity-- you've kind of touched on it. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about? 

 

***AH:*** 

Um. 

 

*AH:* 

It’s okay. And then anything else, just in general that you'd like to share about this memory? 

 

***AH:*** 

Um, no, I don’t think so. Speaker 

 

*AH:*  

Okay, so that will be it and if you have nothing else to share. 

*AH:* 

OK. 

*AH:*

I'll go ahead and end it.

*DA:* 

Just letting you know, I started to record.  

 

***BV:*** 

Mhm. 

 

*DA:* 

Okay. All right, so my name is. Dhakir Abdullah and I'm interviewing the community member who committed object ID who contributed object ID 2023-10-14-0013 as part of Lacasa's 50th anniversary Community archive. All right, so what is the name of your object? 

 

***BV:*** 

Uh, this object is called a tiki. 

 

*DA:* 

When and where did you acquire it? Like what year, city? 

 

***BV:*** 

So, this collection of Tikis was amassed throughout my undergrad experience. I would say I first got one in sophomore year, so it would be fall of 2018 when I joined my fraternity. And then I had just gotten a couple more along the way. 

 

*DA:* 

Okay. What is the date of the item’s creation? 

 

***BV:*** 

The date of the item’s creations vary I would. Just say fall ‘18, fall 2018. 

 

*DA:* 

Okay. Now, how would you physically describe uh, your object? 

 

***BV:*** 

So these objects are made out of wood and they're carved into a cultural object that is known throughout my fraternity. It's one of our cultural symbols that we use to identify ourselves with, and it's carved into the shape, and it also has lettering, engravings that have Greek letters on them that are-- have a specific meaning to the members of within my fraternity 

 

*DA:* 

Okay, thank you so much. What is this object’s significance? 

 

***BV:*** 

So the significance of this object really is just a physical tie to my fraternity. Um, I either wear them around my neck or I have them dangling from my rearview mirror in my car at all times. Um, just having them with me is a great way for me to reflect back every single day um, on the challenges and journeys that I went through throughout college here as a first generation college student trying to navigate my way throughout higher education, honestly, um, without much help. Just kind of walking through a little bit lost and then I had --(clears throat)--come to La Casa and I had met my future fraternity brothers and they had welcomed me with open arms and fast forward um, you know, I joined the fraternity and it's been nothing but amazing um, outcomes ever since then. These past five years and it helps, you know, just helps bring me back to that physical connection that I always have with the greatest support system in the world. I have my other fellow Latino hermanos um, that are out there succeeding in the world, defying status quos, and doing the best that we can, even though we're graduating, we're still part of this fraternity uh, because our motto is  --(Spanish)-- la unidad para siempre-- of unity forever. And it's just every day, you know, if I'm going through something, I always have my brothers there to have my back um, and especially if I'm facing a different challenge in my career and in the workforce world um, there’s older hermanos there who have experienced that or gone through, gone through the same circumstances and difficulties that I've gone through, um, as well as them being able to help me professionally, um having that network of older Latinos to look, that I look up to and having again the network of younger Latinos that look up to me, um, it's just a great feeling to know that no matter where I am in my age or how long ago I joined the fraternity, new or young, um, all the hermanos are able to help out each other. 

 

*DA:* 

Very good, very good. Thanks for sharing that. When you see this object, what kind of memories does it bring up? 

***BV:*** 

Uh, when I see these objects, it brings back um, memories of my honestly, my best memories of college, throws me back to the days of pledging with my line brothers and just learning about the fraternity and just knowing that that was my path of becoming um, a successful leader. Going through that leadership development process and just you know, after you know, going through it and everything and just being on campus with my, with my hermanos, all the time, um, just brings back any type of college memory, just whether it be studying late night at the IMU (Indiana Memorial Union), putting on um, you know, resume workshops through the paternity or was it just hanging back, hanging out of the house watching TV and you know eating pizza late at night. 

 

*DA:* 

Yeah, yeah, I feel that. If you are an IU alum, how does this object relate to your experience at IU and you might have already kind of covered that so you can decide if you want to answer that or just burn up on that or not. 

 

***BV:*** 

Yeah, so it relates to IU because uh, without coming to you and then without coming to La Casa, I don't think I would have ever met um, too many, I wouldn’t have branched out and I would never have met the hermanos. Um, being a lighter skinned Latino it definitely has its, it's, you know, difficulties within that of course definitely a little bit more privileged in a lot of aspects of life. Uh, but when it comes to connecting culturally um, can have a lot of disparities and coming to the La Casa, meeting the hermanos and just being able to be myself and be able to be confident and fully aware of who I am as a Latino male, um, it just brings a lot of great confidence and-- what was the question? What was the part of the question again? 

 

*DA:* 

Um, how does this object-- 

 

***BV:*** 

--relate to IU? 

 

*DA:* 

 Huh? 

 

***BV:*** 

How does it relate to IU? 

 

*DA:* 

 Yeah.  

 

***BV:*** 

Yeah, yeah. Okay. 

 

*DA:* 

And what’s your experience  been? 

 

***BV:*** 

Yeah, sorry about that. Yeah, so ,so just seeing it just brings me back to all the memories of being at IU. And that just honestly, just being a big turning point of my life when I came to came to IU, just not even knowing I was going to come to college, you know, getting a scholarship being able to come here and have all these great experiences. And then just having my life fully transform um, through this fraternity, I think that 100% without joining this fraternity and going through that leadership development process, and being surrounded by the support system that I have um, that I want to be in the position I'm in today, um, I fully 100% believe that in all aspects of my personal life and my professional career alike, it has helped round me out as a man and an individual overall. 

 

*DA:* 

Very good, very good. How does this object relate to your identity? 

 

***BV:*** 

Uh, relates to my identity because it is a cultural object for my Latino fraternity, and that it just right there, it just um, I'm able to relate it from the piece of wood to the fraternity to how I feel and the fraternity and how I get along with all my hermanos and how we network with each other and always have each others back. 

 

*DA:* 

Okay, okay, very good. Um, is there anything I didn't ask you about this object that you would like to talk about? 

 

***BV:*** 

Um, I would just say that these objects, um, no matter where they're at, as long as I see them, they always give me a sense of pride and they always give me a sense of nostalgia just taking me back to the good old days of being on campus, being an undergrad. And just really like it's just crazy to look back on that time and just, you know, being in the position I'm in now just knowing that that was when this time, that four year span of being on campus and enjoying the fraternity and going through, you know, hosting all of the events that we did and helping out the Latino minority community alike. Um, it just brings a great sense of joy and just being able to look at them just every day, just some simple reminder of uh, the impact I've had and the impact that I continue to have on others. 

 

*DA:* 

Okay, okay. That's the end of the-- end of the interview. Thank you so much for participating in the interview.

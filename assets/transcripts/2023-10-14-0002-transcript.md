Okay, so my name is Dhakir Abdullah and I'm interviewing the community member who contributed object ID 2023-10-14-0002. As part of La Casa's 50th, ACCs 25th anniversary community archive 

All right, which memory would you like to share with us today? 

 

***JH:*** 

Um, more so no to, not so much a memory but more. So just a general appreciation. I'm currently a junior here at IU. So not yet an alumni. But it's safe to say that La Casa has been one of the most important parts of me being here academically. It's it's like a melting pot for all like the Latino community here at IU. If you ever need anything, you can come down and either talk to Lillian, she's amazing. But La Casa just has stuffed like everything that you would need, like resources to help tutoring. If you need it just at your disposal, compared to like a lot, a lot of other say that I'm like in the Kelley School of Business, there isn't those such resources that are available, like individually without coming at a price. And La Casa has been amazing, like provide those resources for minorities for free, which is a really big help. And I know that it's been very impactful for a lot of friends that I know, as well as I came into contact with La Casa straight out the gate. It was Welcome Week, freshman year, first semester. And I met a lot of unique and amazing orgs throughout that time, and I decided to partake in one of them. I'm currently in Sigma Lamda Beta, which is a historically Latino fraternity, which runs a ton of events here from La Casa just because I said it's like our own little hub, our own little community. And it's been really amazing.

Okay, thank you. Thank you. Is there a particular memory that is significant to you? 

 

***JH:*** 

Um, really, I think, the most significant memories like recently, we had a fundraiser here at La Casa. Um, and it was really amazing seeing how many people came out and supported like each organizations we sold like, agua de horchata and jamaica just to like, procure money, as usual, just because it's an organization. But it was really, really amazing seeing all the support that we got from not even other like Latino Greek organizations. But literally everybody who was either walking through the street or was just like funneling through La Casa, like they came out and supported, and it just like, like, makes it real, like how much support just the location of La Casa like, just being here really offers. 

 

*DA:*

Awesome, awesome. How does this, well, I don't want to ask you that question, because it was kind of couched in what you already said. But how does the memory share relate to your identity? 

 

 

***JH:*** 

So I think that Latinos come from a long line of like hustlers per se. We it's always a race to get ahead especially, I mean, being in the middle of Indiana, there's not many resources that IU, IU does offer a lot of resources, but I researched surrounding areas that really give you and I say that I grew up in a household where it was like it was it was ambitious, for sure. It was definitely like eat or get eaten mentality. Um, so that really like gave me like the super ambitious mindset. And with La Casa being here, I feel like I've changed from like, like a very like selfish mentality for more of like a community wide because I like look around and like, all my peers here have gone through very similar things that I've gone through. I might not be exact, but it's still very similar. And I can't just like set them aside and like act like they didn't do what I've done. So I think that especially if they're like my, my organization, we've chosen a community approach rather than like putting yourself forward, putting like the community forward because it's like I said, it's very difficult to do so in an environment like IU. 

 

*DA:*

I feel that we kind of have to wrap up, but I got one last question. Is there anything that I asked that, is there anything that I asked that? Is there anything I didn't ask is what I was trying to say that you would like to talk about? 

 

***JH:*** 

Um, nah I think that's really good questions. 

 

*DA:*

All right. Well, thank you so much. I really appreciate you

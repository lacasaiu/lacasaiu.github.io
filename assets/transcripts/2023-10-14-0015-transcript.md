My name is Alexia, and I'm interviewing the community Member, Ursula, who contributed object ID 2023-10-14-0015. So my first question for you today, Ursula, is which memory would you like to share with us today?. 

***UU:***

Today, while I'm sharing this picture from the East Chicago. Hispanic heritage? Well, I guess Hispanic Heritage month now, but back then, it was the Mexican Independence Day parade. This would have been 1991, September and so this would have been my first year at IU. And so we traveled up back to East Chicago and I'm from Munster, which is next door to Chicago and this is my one of the first times I’d ever seen the parade. And definitely my first time in the parade. 
 
*AH:*
Anything else you'd like to share about why it's significant to you? Kind of touched a little bit, but. 
 
***UU:***
Yeah, this is significant to me because it was my first time in this particular parade, even though my grandparents owned a store in the harbor like I. I don't really remember ever seeing this parade because we lived in Munster, which was a very white suburb of Chicago and on the Indiana side and was very close to East Chicago in the harbor. But my parents never took us there. We didn't really speak Spanish in the home growing up. Even though my parents are both Mexican and so it would. Being at IU and being in LUIU was basically my first exposure to people who grew up, like in Mexican culture and being at this. Mexican Independence Day parade was like my first experience with like, a a bunch of Mexicans, I guess, and it was really interesting. And this is like, you know, I'm in this traditional dress right here. And and I think this is my first time in that type of outfit. So it was just, it was really interesting. To me. 

*AH:*

And so you mentioned IU and how you’re an IU Alum. So does this memory at all relate to your experience here at IU? Or does it? 

***UU:***

Like yeah, it may want to know more about. The Latino experience, I guess because I really didn't have that growing up and I really immersed myself into LUIU. I made more Latino friends and I really like basically lived at like La Casa while I was here. I made my the best friends I've ever had here. I'm still friends with them 30 some years later. And yeah, the best. The best friends I've had were from IU. 

*AH:*

And how you've talked a little bit about how it's related to your identity and how your identity has grown. Is there anything else you'd like to talk about concerning your identity in this memory? 

***UU:***

Yeah, I I went on to get my masters in teaching and I and I taught chemistry, physics, biology. But I also became bilingual because I felt it was important to give back to that community and I knew that, you know, science teachers are hard to find. But a bilingual science teacher is even harder. And even though my parents didn't really speak to us in Spanish. In the home, because I was the first born, they spoke to me the most out of the three of us, and so I did have some Spanish. And so it was easier for me to become bilingual than probably most people like, especially my siblings and and so I did that because I wanted to give back to the. Community. And so yeah. Yeah, I because I felt like I got in touch with that here so maybe want to do that in my professional life. 

*AH:*

I’m gonna go a little off script. So you're you said you like, did teaching and you did like science. So did you teach here in Indiana or? Like Chicago area or? 

***UU:***

Chicago Public Schools. Yeah, CPS. So and in Las Vegas, too. I I taught both places and I did my student teaching in Martinsville. So yeah, that was interesting. 

*AH:*

Do you feel like you know? Trying to think how I want to word it like like your influence. Like do you think part of like your identity and like how you've like grown as a person over the years? Like do you think it's been very helpful? Like in the classroom like to help you teach your students. 

***UU:***

It has definitely giving me more empathy because like I said, you know, when I grew up, I grew up in this pretty white suburban area at Munster. And my parents had not exposed us to a lot of our culture. And so yeah, being here that you, even though it is in a pretty white area of Indiana and this little, you know. La Familia, lLa Casa, is like, you know, for me, it was my first exposure, which is probably pretty strange being in southern Indiana.  Yeah. But yeah, this. Yeah. 

*AH:*

And so I have just one final question. Is there anything that I haven't asked you that you would like to share, you know about this memory about La Casa about IU, anything else? 
 

***UU:***

In one of the talks that we were doing across the way in the salary, they talked about leadership in in LUIU and how it helps you prepare for leadership roles later on. And the President of value I when I was a freshman was Maria Fuentes, and the way she ran meetings. Helped me when I became president of Out later on, which was the GLBT organization that was here at IU. And then now when I run meetings in my organizations at home in Naperville, where I live well. 

*AH:*

Well, thank you, Ursula. If you have nothing else, you. Want to say right now before we end? 

***UU:***

I'm good, thanks. 

*AH:*
Thank you.

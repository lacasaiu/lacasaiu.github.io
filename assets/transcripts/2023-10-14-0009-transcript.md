My name is Alexia, and I'm interviewing the community member, Ivonne, who contributed object ID 2023-10-14-0009 as part of La Casa’s 50th anniversary Community Archive. So, can you tell me which memory you would like to share with us today? 

 

***IR:*** 

Sure. Um, this is more like uh, one big memory of founding the—co-founding the organization DREAM IU on campus. So this was about 2009 and I graduated 2012 and continued it a little bit after that. 

 

*AH:* 

Okay. And why is this memory significant to you? 

 

***IR:*** 

So, DREAM IU, it was an organization that I founded with um, friends in the-- who I met here on campus who are already doing some um, activist work for the DREAM Act, which is for undocumented students and um, they were already working in Indianapolis with some different people and politicians and starting some work there. And because we're in Bloomington, not everybody had cars and it was also important to engage this university. It just um, it opened up a lot of, you know, like awareness in the community, in the, in the university. We got-- by summer of 2010 I believe we got the President McRobbie at that time to support the DREAM Act publicly. So it was just um, it was work that meant a lot to us. It was an achievement on campus. It taught us so many life skills—um, how to reach out, how to work with administrators. Um, it humbled us to um, be on the corner and try to get signatures when sometimes that's like, a lot of people, that's very hard work. Um, it also allowed us skills to present to Master students in classrooms and answer questions that made us go research further into, like, immigration websites and I think it taught us just so many skills that um, that are invaluable and it made us closer. There's the friendships that um, when you go through some um, trying situation, especially when maybe a topic is like this is not always even um, people aren't always that open to speaking about it, especially at that time. It was, it was definitely growth for, for each one of us. 

 

*AH:* 

And as an IU alum, how does this memory like, you know, relate to your experience at IU? Maybe just a little bit more, I know you kind of touched on it a little bit. 

***IR:*** 

Yeah, just it, it's, it took up a significant amount of my time on campus, um, and that's also like why a lot of my college memories are tied to that. Um, besides being in the School of Business and studying German and studying economics like it, it those things kept me busy, but also this organization. It was very significant. I was a Senator Lugar scholar. So even when the senator came down to campus, I was able to get some of us to be there in person. Um, but anyway, I think the, I always say that, the number one thing I got out of college were um, the friendships I made because there were, there are people that really taught me a lot of things about life and how they supported me through some really difficult moments. And this is a group. 

 

*AH:* 

And I feel like you've touched on this, but if you want to like touch a little bit more on it, like how does this memory relate to your identity? 

 

***IR:*** 

Um, being part of this organization and being a leader in it has, like helped me also develop parts of myself and how I approach different things. Um, I'm a Capricorn and I feel like we're very much like take charge and I think this organization really pushed me in different ways. Um, just because of the opportunities and the time and the variety, it pushed me in different ways also to continue like shaping me and um, how we work with others. 

 

*AH:* 

OK, so I got one final question. So, is there anything I didn't ask you that you would like to share or talk about concerning this memory? 

 

***IR:*** 

Um, just in general, to document that I appreciate the efforts of all the people that were involved, all the people that you know gave us a signature that um, supported us, that gave us car rides that were there at City Hall. There was uh, Pedro Roman from the Latino caucus in the state. Lillian Casillas, um, she helped us if we ever needed a space to meet. Um, we had our advisors for our organization, Lalo Vargas, Melissa Quintela, we had Melanie from the Asian Culture Center. Um, I'm missing some people I'm spacing out, but like Cari and Tari Morales were very important. Uh, Ronack Shah, very important—Manel, Alex, Diana, like we had a variety of support and um, Sarah who I’m going to see in Chicago. And just I'm missing names, but I just want to say thank you to everybody that supported us. 

 

*AH:* 

Well, thank you for your time. I’m going to go ahead and end this.

All right. All right, my name is Dhakir Abdullah. And I'm interviewing the community, the community member who contributed object ID 202-310-1400 03 as part of La Casa's 50th ACC's 25th anniversary community archive. Okay. So which memory would you like to share with us today? 

***OCA:***

Well, um, I can share vert oral history, you know, what my time when I was here, and what were the highlights that I think, you know, would be of interest? I could do that. 

*DA:* 

Okay. 

***OCA:***

By the way, my name is Olga Cruz Arreguin. 

*DA:* 

Okay, okay. And I didn't ask for your name on the interview, because they don't ask us to do that. So 

***OCA:***

Just like, please, I don't want anybody to get blamed for something I might say. 

*DA:* 

I feel you, I feel you. So what, what is one of the most significant memories for you? 

***OCA:***

Well, there are so many there. You know, back in the mid 70s, we were still fighting for La Casa and fighting to increase our numbers, and even now, I don't know what the statistics are, but I'm going to assume that it's not enough students. We were struggling as a group, because many of us were the first ones to come to college, and our parents, our families didn't really understand what, you know, our experiences were here. So it was hard to get support for that they would support us in their own way, but not anything that was, you know, directly addressing some of the things that we encountered. A lot of it had to do with self confidence. And the ability to believe in ourselves that we can succeed in a situation like this, where we were a microcosm of the whole population. And I heard a girl this morning, and one of the morning sessions say, she feels that way now, and it makes me sad, because I feel like 50 years later, that hasn't changed. And so there, we need to address that immediately. So anyway, my one of the highlights of my being here was understanding things about myself, for example, that I had a voice and that I could use it. And so I was very active in the student group, that was here, the Hispanic student group, and, you know, I made my voice heard to the rest of the campus. So when we have rallies, when we had, you know, active activist types of organization, activities, like marching, etc. You know, I made sure that our voices were heard, and I was not afraid to do that. That was something I learned about myself then. So since then, I've always believed in speaking out and being heard. 

 

*DA:* 

Thank you so much. You've already answered the third question. But with the fourth question, how does this memory and intrinsically relate to your identity? 

 

***OCA:***

Well, I think that people from from an individual perspective, if you ask people to say, "do you know, Olga," they'd say, "Oh, yeah," And it may be in the context of when I was here. And then later in life, those that still that I still know that I still see, would probably, even those that I don't will probably say she stands up for what she believes in, and she's not afraid to say so. And I think that that's probably the gist of it. I learned to do that here. 

 

*DA:* 

Okay, thank you so much. Is there anything I didn't ask you that you would like to talk about? 

 

***OCA:***

No, I think that being here, being here is is interesting. It's uncomfortable, because I was hoping, I don't know why, but I was hoping that I would see some of my former classmates makes me a little bit emotional but I didn't. I was hoping I was not expecting to, but I was hoping. And it's been so many years that I don't, I look around and I don't see any of them. And that's because we're older or busy, you know, but I see a lot of young people and not enough men. Why is that? What happened to the guys on campus? Maybe they just feel this is kind of hokey. You know, so we need to make sure that we can bring them in somebody said this morning. I don't know how to come to La Casa, when do I come to La Casa, does there have to be a special event. And I remember when I was here, La Casa was a community. That's what needs to happen again. And I'm really tough. Over over the years, you know, I've been a management for maybe 35 or 40 years in my career. I'm kind of tough about some of these things. Don't ask those questions. Why, what where are the male students? And why are students still expressing the same things that we did then? I think the answer is going to be "well, that's always going to happen," because we need more funds, we need more staff, we need you have to create a community in this building. Is there still a student organization like there was when I was here? There has to be an active student organization. That's how we learned to be outspoken, strong leaders because we were part of that organization. Otherwise this building this La Casa is just mortar and brick. There's nothing behind it and I, I, I'm just curious about

I feel you.

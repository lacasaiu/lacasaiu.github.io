My name is Alexia, and I'm interviewing the community member Miles, who contributed object ID number 2023-10-14-0022. So, my first question today, then, is which memory would you like to share with us today? 

 

***MT:***

Today, the memory I'm sharing is the 2018 La Casa graduation ceremony. That was a a super significant day because, you know, I went to the the main ceremony, obviously the Neil Marshall Center, but it was the only graduation out of my entire academic career that I knew everyone that I was graduating with and I was friends and had some kind of relationship with everyone and it was really significant because I remember Lillian had asked me to be a part of the ceremony and it's just such a good feeling to be welcomed by another culture that was that was really a life changing moment there. 

 

*AH:*

And so, as an IU alum is there any more you wanted to share about like this particular memory? Or would you like to just talk about a memory in general other than this? 

 

***MT:***

Um, I just remember whenever I would come here like, just always being welcomed here it all. It always felt like kind of like a a home away from home. Everybody was just always, you know, we would have we, whether we be playing cards sometimes or just having like an intellectual conversation or just talking about the the silliest things in pop culture and things like that. It's too many memories that I have here to just boil down to one. 

 

*AH:*

And how does the memory about the graduation relate to your identity? Or you know, even just your memories here at La Casa? How does it relate to your identity? 

 

***MT:***

Its kind of it it relates to my identity in the sense that I'd say that I probably would identify maybe with two cultures, probably now you know as a as a black man growing up in America, I definitely know all about my own culture. Obviously, I participated in my whole life, but my time here has made me make friends, make make newer friends, and spend time with their families in their households. And it it's made me kind of also identify with another culture, That's that's kind of how it's had an impact on my identity. 

 

*AH:*

And just finally, is there anything that I haven't asked that you would like to talk about? 

 

***MT:***

Oh no, I don't think that might be OK. 

 

*AH:*

So, if you don't have anything else, I'm going to go ahead and end the recording OK.

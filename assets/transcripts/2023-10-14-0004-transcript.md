The record is on in case you know, just so you know. Alright, so my name is Dhakir Abdullah and I'm interviewing the community member who contributed object ID. 2023-10-14-0004. As part of the La Casa's 50th ACC 25th Anniversary Community Archive. So what is the name of your object? 

 

***VE:*** 

So I actually have a photo that was taken during the La Casa's  45th anniversary, so five years ago. 

 

*DA:*

Oh, how cool. Ohh. OK. So I guess I don't need to really ask the second question because it asked when did you acquire it? 

 

***VE:***

*DA:*

*DA:*

OK. OK. And although it is it, a digital digital object, how would you physically describe your object? 

 

 

 

 

***VE:*** 

So this is a photo. Like I said, it was taken at the 50, 5th, 45th anniversary event there's four women in here, so going from left to right we have Denise, Annie, Lillian, who is the director of La Casa currently and was the director during that time. Then I'm in the photo, and then at the end, on the right is Perla. 

 

*DA:*

OK. Thank you so much for that. What is this object's significance? 

 

***VE:*** 

So we had all gone to the 45th anniversary a a bunch of my friends were still living in town, so it was just a joyous occasion to celebrate La Casa, like we're celebrating it to now with the 50th anniversary. Back then, a lot of my friends that I had made early on during my PhD program were still living here, so we had kind of gone to a group. So these were kind of like some of the ladies that I spent a lot of time with who were people like outside of my department. So these ladies, were from, like, sociology and and biochemistry, so it's just like some of the like community that I made of Latinas here at Bloomington. 

 

*DA:*

OK, OK. OK, when you see this object, what kind of memories does it bring up? 

 

***VE:*** 

A lot of happy and fun memories, so especially with Denise, and Perla. We actually ended up living together during the pandemic, and actually I moved in with them and then got my dog, Chilaquil . So they're my dogs, tias, their aunt, his aunts. So yeah, I always have lots of like fun going out laughing, type of like memories with with all of these ladies, which is always like cracking up. always food around. Yeah, just always like having a good time. Just like some of the, like, really like joyous memories that I have with associated with La Casa and then also like associated just with like the like good friends that I made here. 

 

*DA:*

OK, OK. If you're an IU Alum How does this object relate to your experience at IU? 

 

 

***VE:*** 

It's a positive experience, so I kind of mentioned like it's kind of the community that I that I built that sort of like helped me get through like some of the like tough times of the Ph.D so like. We would come to La Casa and have like, study sessions over the on the weekends and we would have like food or even just like going out and doing fun things. So just, you know, kind of like some of the people that sort of helped me get through like the harder times. 

 

*DA:*

OK, I understood. I understood that. How does this object relate to your identity? 

 

***VE:*** 

It's a it's a group of successful Latina women, how I sort of see myself, and I think it is like some of the people that sort of helped me like connect stronger with that identity I feel like before coming to IU like I didn't necessarily. Call myself Latina in those senses. I would always use like Hispanic and part of it was like I grew up in, like more diverse areas like living in Florida and living in Arizona like the Latina community is pretty big, but coming to Bloomington like even that was very accustomed to being in white. spaces it wasn't. It was different. Here like I didn't, I didn't always see like people that kind of like looked like me. So it was just like, ort of building that like bond and I feel like I sort of like in my time being here at IU and associated with La Casa too. It's just kind of helping me develop a stronger connection to that side of my identity. 

 

*DA:*

OK, thanks for sharing that. Now, is there anything I didn't ask you concerning your object that you would like to talk about? 

***VE:*** 

No, I think that captures most of it. 

 

*DA:*

All right. Well, thank you so much. For participating in interview.

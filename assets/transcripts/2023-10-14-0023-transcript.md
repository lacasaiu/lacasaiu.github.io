Recording my name is Vanessa, and I'm interviewing the community member who contributed object ID 2023-10-14-0023. Um, so are you sharing a photo?  

 

***EL:***

Yes. 

 

*VE:* 

Okay, um, so what's the, what's in the photo? 

 

***EL:***

I guess I'll start off with--actually, of a recent photo that wasn't take I'm not in it, but it's the Latino Male Initiative. It's one of those recent photos one of my friends took and I shared this one because, well, me and Lillian were actually the ones who started that in 20, when did I get here? 20, 20, 2015, which would be because it was the spring after, spring semester freshman year. Um, I had to do a program here La CasaI because I worked, I worked here for two years. So you have to do uh, an event and Lillian was like, “Well, what do you want to do?” Well, I said, “Well, let me just figure out something just to engage more of the Latino male and the and here on campus and, and in the community. And she, me and her brainstorm, bounce ideas off and she’s like, “Well, why don't you do a panel?” So I do a panel and I got 3 Latino males, a graduate student, and a professor and mentor, and then I just asked questions, everyone had a good time, it was a good turn out. And then afterwards Lillian had the idea of, well, why don't you just kind of do this routinely? And then I think I asked, “Well, do you mean like, in a monthly, weekly, semester or, what are we thinking here? So after bouncing off ideas, she's like, “Well, why don't we just do this biweekly? Make it like for sure like group that meets, and we just talk.” And then that's when the Latino Male Initiative, you know, was born. And I think afterwards, a semester or two I can't remember, but the Latino Male Initiative and then the LGBT one followed too. So. I'm very honored and just very happy that it's still here and it's something that I can say that it's me and Lillian really worked at it back in the day and it's just very, I don't know, it's a surreal just to really think about it, but. 

 

*VE:* 

Yeah, and it's still continuing so your legacy lives on. 

 

***EL:***

Yeah. And it-- literally though, it's-- I haven't thought about it like that it's just something that, I don't know. It's just something I just did in undergrad, but looking back at this here, my friends do it. Going to the event today and they're like, “Oh, well, aren’t you the one who did?” I'm like, “Well, yeah.” It doesn't feel like that long ago, but it really has been like, almost 10 years coming up, I'm like --(inhales, laughs)-- 

 

*VE:* 

Um, could you describe the photo for, for me? 

 

***EL:***

Yeah, the photo itself is, like I said, it's a recent one, not, um, but it's just a bunch of again, Latino males just getting together, chopping it up, just talking about certain issues, how we feel about it, how, how, how our identity, you know, mixes with the community. 

 

*VE:* 

How many is-- was the photo taken here in La Casa or? 

 

***EL:***

Yeah. So, yeah, right out there.  

 

*VE:* 

Outside? 

 

***EL:***

Yeah, right outside. 

 

*VE:* 

Okay. How many people are in the photo? 

 

***EL:***

It has to be one, two, three, fifteen?  

 

*VE:* 

Okay.  

 

***EL:***

Fifteen to twenty. 

 

*VE:* 

Do you know when this photo was taken? 

 

***EL:***

Sometime in 20, before the pandemic, it seems like --(laughs)-- yeah, 2020, 2021? 

 

*VE:* 

Okay. Um, so you talked a little bit about the significance already the--because you created the male initiative. Is there anything else that you want to say about, like, the significance of this photo or the program in relation to, like, your time here at IU? 

 

***EL:***

Yeah, I mean starting that, who really helped me? Again, get in contact with a bunch of people, networking, bring me out of my shell. I mean, I was the shy guy that really brought me out because later on I then started my fraternity Lambda Sigma Upsilon Fraternity incorporated. And um, and that was kind of easy to do just because, like I did all the event planning, organization, logistics of the Latino Male Initiative. Um, and those skills are getting transferred into doing LSU, the frat, so, so yeah, the significance it's, it's, it's immense. 

 

*VE:* 

Um, you kind of mentioned a little bit, but in case you wanted to elaborate a little bit more, what kind of memories, like seeing that photo does it bring up for you? 

 

***EL:***

Well, that this recent memory because I know there's more photos out there --(laughs)--uh, but during my time I knew, um, we were just meeting at La Casa, you know, having our chats, um, I think our days were Wednesdays or Tuesdays or something like that. But I told them, why don't we do something outside La Casa? Like, just take this group and let's move it. And so I do remember taking one photo. We went down to this painting, paintball range of near here. Um, and I think that doing that really just brought us together in a way and just, just taking people out and then just, I don't know, it just made the whole experience just way better. 

 

*VE:* 

Mhm. Um, you kind of also already mentioned it, but just in case you wanted to elaborate. So you’re an IU alum, so how does the photo relate to your experience here at IU? 

 

***EL:***

It just reminds me of just being close with everyone. Just talking and just, I just remember everyone just being very vocal and just very vulnerable and just sitting down and just talking about like, “Well, how do you really feel?” Just getting down to the nitty gritty of things, um, and just make-- knowing that there's someone that, that that relates to me and so. 

 

*VE:* 

Um, how does the-- it could be the program or just looking at the photo um-- relate to like aspects of your identity. 

 

***EL:***

Well, my identity, I feel like I come from a really big family. A bunch of tios, tias, cousins, everybody. So when I look at this photo of the recent one of the Latino Male Initiative, I just picture like a big old, big family. You have all the tios, like they all congregate at one you know, corner or whatever around the bonfire with drinking, whatever. And that's what it reminded me of. Like, it's just that familiar, right? It feels familiar. I can't say that. Word, right? But it just felt comfortable. It just felt like I, I just, I needed to be there. And I guess just felt like home. 

 

*VE:* 

Wonderful. Um, is there anything that I didn't ask you about the photo or about the initiative that you started that you would like to share? 

 

***EL:***

Mm, no I think we pretty much covered the gist of it. Uh, I guess I could talk more and more about it, but, no, I'm just very happy that's still here. People are really engaging with it and I'm hap--happy to contribute as much as I can now, again, because I know after college things change, life gets in the way, you get busy, um, and I would love to come back and help as much as I can as an alone. 

*VE:* 

Awesome. Thank you so much for sharing.

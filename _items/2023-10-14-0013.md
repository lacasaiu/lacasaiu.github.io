contributorquote: "Without coming to you and without coming to La Casa, I wouldn’t have branched out and I would never have met the hermanos… These objects, no matter where they're at, as long as I see them, they always give me a sense of pride and they always give me a sense of nostalgia just taking me back to the good old days of being on campus, being an undergrad… that four year span of being on campus and enjoying the fraternity and going through, you know, hosting all of the events that we did and helping out the Latino minority community alike."

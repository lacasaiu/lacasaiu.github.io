contributorquote: "Because we're in Bloomington, not everybody had cars and it was also important to engage this university. It opened up a lot of awareness in the [Latino] community in the university. By summer of 2010 I believe we got President McRobbie at that time to support the DREAM Act publicly. So it was work that meant a lot to us. It was an achievement on campus. It taught us so many life skills: how to reach out, how to work with administrators. It humbled us to be on the corner and try to get signatures when sometimes that's a lot of people, that's very hard work."

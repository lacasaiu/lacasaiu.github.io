contributorquote: "I was the shy guy that really brought me out because later on I then started my fraternity Lambda Sigma Upsilon Fraternity incorporated. That was kind of easy to do just because, I did all the event planning, organization, logistics of the Latino Male Initiative. Those skills are getting transferred into doing LSU, the frat, the significance, it's immense."

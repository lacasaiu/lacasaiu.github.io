contributorquote: "We keep this on our mantel at home, not only because we're married, but it's a nice reminder of some of the best times in our lives. We've had a great life. I mean, they’re just wonderful experiences that IU and La Casa have given us through our education through meeting people. It's a great reminder and everyone we know, and we talk to this day, there's no one that we're not in touch with."

contributorquote: "One of the highlights of my being here was understanding things about myself, that I had a voice and that I could use it. I was very active in the student group, that was here, the Hispanic student group, and I made my voice heard to the rest of the campusâ€¦ There has to be an active student organization. That's how we learned to be outspoken, strong leaders because we were part of that organization. Otherwise this building this La Casa is just mortar and brick."

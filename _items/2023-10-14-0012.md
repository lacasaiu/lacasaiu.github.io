contributorquote: "My first couple weeks I was here on campus as a transfer student, I struggled to find people that looked like me, but as soon as I looked for it, I found it. Now that I know everyone [at La Casa] is just a tight-knit community that I can just talk to anyone and it's nice. If I'm going to the IMU (Indiana Memorial Union) I recognize people there. I go to the library, I know people there just because they look like me. We can just talkâ€¦ it makes talking easier and kind of just easier."

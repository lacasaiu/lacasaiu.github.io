contributorquote: "That was a super significant day because I went to the main ceremony, obviously the Neal Marshall Center, but it was the only graduation out of my entire academic career that I knew everyone that I was graduating with and I was friends with and had some kind of relationship with everyone. It was really significant because I remember Lillian had asked me to be a part of the ceremony and it's just such a good feeling to be welcomed by another culture. That was really a life changing moment there."

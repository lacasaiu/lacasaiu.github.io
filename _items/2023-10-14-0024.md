contributorquote: "I had all the reasons to go back home and back home was Fort Wayne, and it was that guilt that stayed with me for a long time because there was a part of me that said I should quit and get a job and help my mother, who had up to that point, only worked part-time and hourly jobs. So I knew they were struggling and I made the decision to stay at IU. In hindsight it was the best decision I could have made, but it was fraught with a lot of challenges and La Casa, specifically, Lillian provided that support and community… At the end of the day, really, it's the people that are here that have such a huge impact. Like I said, [I] will forever be grateful."

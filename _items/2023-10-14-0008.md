contributorquote: "I just was one of those kids that just really wanted to be involved in things, so I decided that I really wanted to be part of the salsa dancing group or the dance club... So I asked if I could join it because I was 17 and I was in high school,  but I was taking classes here so I had a loophole to participate in activities... I was very young and but I was very precocious and just curious and I wanted it. To be part of something and I missed being part of the community because I just moved from South Florida, where it's full of Latinos and diversity and I also grew up in Northwest Indiana and Chicago."

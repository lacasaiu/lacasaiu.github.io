contributorquote: "It was a pivotal time coming to La Casa thinking, 'OK, one day I like I think I want to do Greek Life' and meeting five other just phenomenal women that have been so supportive and changed the trajectory of how I felt. I didn't really fit into the IU campus being so huge and finally finding your home away from home, that story, but also giving back to the community and supporting other women in the campus so they felt there was a safe place for them to come together and empower one another."

contributorquote: "It's really memorable for me because not only was it my first retreat organized and as grad assistant, but it was also the first year that my brother was here as a freshman. It brought my two worlds together for the first time and as the oldest daughter of immigrants, it was the first true representation that I was like, 'Oh wow, I'm really paving the way for the family.'... I think La Casa for me was the home away from home ever since I joined IU, but more importantly if it wasn't for Lillian, I wouldn't even have graduated."

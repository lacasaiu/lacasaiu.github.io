contributorquote: "One of my favorite memories is the support in the community that La Casa gave to me when I had no one. Being a single parent was so hard and then trying to get an education was even harder. But La Casa you always, I mean I could always bank on coming here with my son, and people not being angry about Felipe being around, playing around and then us being able to take time for not only myself, but to study, to get myself grounded... La Casa means even more because I am not who I am, I am who I am because of La Casa."

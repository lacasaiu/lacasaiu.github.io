shortdesc: "La Casa has been around for over 50 years, but did you know that there was an Office for Latino AffairsÂ as well as La Casa? La Casa was housed under this office which was led by a Dean and Assistant Dean whose office was in Memorial Hall at one point. Now, La Casa is housed under the Office of the Vice President for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (OVPDEI). There is a long history of Latine advocates on campus."

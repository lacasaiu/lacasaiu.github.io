shortdesc: "The majority of the programs and meetings are held in the living room. On one end of the room you see a large TV screen and computer system often used for presentations or to display many of the flyers that share information on upcoming events or services. On the other end of the room, one can find resource materials on IU and community services as well as Latine groups. Whether you need information, want to hear a speaker or simply catch-up on what is happing, this is the room to be."

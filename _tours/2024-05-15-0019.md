shortdesc: "The library is a space within the center that is used in a variety of ways. You can look for books, games, puzzles, and other items to check out but you can also find one of our tutors holding office hours to help students several times a week. A Latine CAPS counselor also holds office hours to see students seeking help when facing stress, anxiety and mental health challenges."

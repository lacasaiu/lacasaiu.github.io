In the fall of 2023, La Casa celebrated its 50th anniversary. This milestone is due to the many students, faculty, staff, and alumni who have contributed to building a strong community. In commemoration of this anniversary, we welcomed back all those who have walked through its doors and supported its advocacy, programs, and services — those who have been a part of La Casa’s life and success!

La Casa alumni brought back memories that we share with the the whole comunidad here.
